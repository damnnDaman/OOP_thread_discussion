# OOP Discussion Board

Welcome to the **OOP Thread Discussion** repository! This repository contains various labs and projects focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JAVA. Each lab is designed to help you understand and apply different OOP principles through practical examples and exercises. Let's dive in and explore what this repository has to offer!

## Repository Structure

- **lab2/**: In this lab, you'll create a simple **Discussion Board** application. It includes user and post management functionalities, allowing for basic interactions like creating and viewing posts. Check out the [Readme.md](lab2/Readme.md) for more details. Spoiler alert: It's more fun than a real discussion board! This lab will introduce you to **collections**, **file I/O**, and **basic UI design** concepts.

- **lab4/**: This lab focuses on more complex OOP concepts and design patterns, such as **factory methods**, **observer patterns**, and **dependency injection**. You'll also tackle **exception handling** and **unit testing** to ensure that your code works as expected. Get ready to flex those brain muscles and write some elegant, maintainable code. It's like a workout, but for your brain!

- **lab5/**: The grand finale! This lab introduces a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for the discussion board application. You'll integrate your previous code into a fully interactive interface, using tools like **JavaFX** or **Swing** to bring your project to life. Check out the GUI and marvel at your creation. It's like the cherry on top of your coding sundae!

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOP_thread_discussion.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired lab folder**:
    ```sh
    cd OOP_thread_discussion/labX
    ```

3. **Follow the instructions** in the respective `Readme.md` files within each lab folder to compile and run the programs. Each lab has its own set of instructions tailored to the specific tasks you'll be working on.

4. For **lab5** (GUI-based project), make sure you have the necessary JavaFX or Swing libraries installed, as well as a suitable IDE for building GUI applications.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- A preferred IDE, such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **NetBeans**, with Java support.
- For lab5, ensure you have **JavaFX** set up if you're working with JavaFX for the GUI.

## Note

- Each lab folder contains a PDF with detailed instructions and explanations. Make sure to read them to get the most out of each lab. The PDFs also provide additional insights into the theoretical concepts of OOP.
- Remember, lab 5 is where the magic happens with the GUI. Don't miss it, as it will help solidify your understanding of both OOP and UI design!
